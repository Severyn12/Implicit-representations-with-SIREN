# Implicit-representations-with-SIREN

The aim of this work is to  to explore an effective method for representing three-dimensional (3D) shapes with the help of a signed distance function (SDF). The representation of 3D objects is a very important task for such spheres as computer graphics, and computer vision, so itâ€™s very important to find an effective and compact way to represent our shapes.
